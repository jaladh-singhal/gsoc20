            And GSoC’20 has finally ended! Last three months of my project
            gave me an incredible learning experience. Not only did I improve
            my software development skills but I also got to know about how
            Astrophysics Research happens. Following is the report of the work
            I did in these Summers at TARDIS.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/tardis-sn">TARDIS</a> is an Open Source
          Astrophysics Org which provides Python packages for rapid spectral
          modeling of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">Supernovae</a>. In
          simpler terms, it allows
          researchers to quickly simulate the exploding Stars. In GSoC’20,
          <a
            href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5290824201404416">my
            project</a> was to build a GUI that makes it easier
          for researchers to explore the data of a simulated Supernova model,
          without knowing its internal data structure. This GUI needed to be
          implemented as several Jupyter widgets that can run within Notebook
          by simply passing the model to a tardis constructor. Hence most of
          my work revolved around developing a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/tree/master/tardis/widgets">widgets
            subpackage</a> within <a
            href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis">tardis</a> that
          allows users to construct a widget of their interest for the model
          they’re working with.

          In this report, you can find the code of all the widgets I developed
          in the last three months of GSoC. But if you’re interested to know
          about the cool Astrophysics concepts behind my work, I encourage you

        <section id="shell-info-widget">
          <h3>Shell Info Widget</h3>
          <p>
            This widget allows users to explore the chemical abundances in
            different shells (computational partitions) of the modeled Supernova
            ejecta. It consists of four interlinked tables - clicking on any row
            in a table, updates the abundance data in the table(s) right of it.

          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed a demo of Shell Info Widget as a notebook where I
              developed its prototype and then progressively refined to make it
              ready for putting it in the module - <a
                href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1146"> #1146 </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a subpackage for widgets and wrote an object-oriented
              interface (as a module) for constructing and displaying Shell Info
              Widget, along with the unit tests and documentation - <a
                href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1166"> #1166 </a>

        <section id="line-info-widget">
          <h3>Line Info Widget</h3>
          <p>
            This widget allows users to explore the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line">atomic
              lines</a>
            responsible for producing features in the simulated spectrum. You
            can select any wavelength range in the spectrum interactively to
            display a table giving the fraction of light packets that
            experienced their last interaction with each species. Using toggle
            buttons, you can specify whether to filter the selected range by the
            emitted or absorbed wavelengths of packets. Clicking on a row in the
            species table shows packet counts for each last line interaction of
            the selected species, which can be grouped in several ways.

            <li>
              Developed a demo of Line Info Widget in a notebook where I did
              several experimentations to make it a fully functional widget (as
              above) by iteratively adding features to a basic prototype - <a

            </li>
            <li>
              Modified legacy implementation of TARDIS <a
                href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardisanalysis/blob/ff79f155d2a8a9073fba237f3b75dfe31ca9aa31/docu/instructions.md#tardis_kromer_plotpy">Kromer
                Plot</a> (spectrum as a stacked area chart showing different
              packets’ interactions it is composed of) so that it can be used in
              Line Info Widget instead of a simple spectrum. I made sure it can
              be constructed directly from a simulation object or a saved
              simulation model (HDF) and has data of both real and virtual
              packets. But before I could convert its plotting method
              (implemented in matplotlib) to interactive <a
                href="https://plotly.com/python/">plotly</a>,
              we realized it’s overly complicated & outdated and needs to be
              fixed first. So we decided to put it on hold until we release Line
              Info Widget with the simple spectrum, to manage the GSoC deadline
              - <a href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1241"> #1241
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Created an object-oriented interface for generating Line Info
              Widget as a module within widgets subpackage, along with unit
              tests and code documentation. Also made several restructuring
              changes in widgets subpackage to improve it - <a

          <h3>Demonstration of Widgets in Docs</h3>
          <p>
            The essential part of any GUI is to let users know not only how to
            use it but also how to make the best use of it. For this, I created
            a <strong>TARDIS Widgets</strong> section in TARDIS docs wherein I
            included a tutorial notebook to generate widgets so that anyone can
            quickly try it out themselves. Besides I included a page to explain
            in detail what each widget does and the helpful features they offer.
            Thanks to the excellent review by my mentors, I made sure that the
            explanation of physics involved in using the widgets is accurate.
            You can access this at <a
              href="https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/running/tardis_widgets">
              TARDIS Widgets </a> section in our docs, as soon as <a
              href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1280"> #1280 </a>
            is merged.

          <p>
            Besides working on the widgets (my main project), I came across
            several other things that needed to be done for making TARDIS
            better:

            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed how virtual packet properties are saved in HDF by
              determining the virtual packet logging status at run-time instead
              of saving it in configuration file - <a
                href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1254"> #1254 </a>

          The end of GSoC does not mean my contributions to TARDIS will end. It
          has always been my pleasure to hear it from the community that my work
          is making their research easier. And learning about the involved
          Astrophysics concepts while developing software, has always inspired
          me to continue contributing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are lots of ideas we have on our <a
            href="https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/projects/5">project
            board</a> about the next steps. The priority tasks that I will
          likely work on next are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adding Kromer Plot to Line Info Widget i.e. finishing PR#1241
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating a widget that shows iterations of a TARDIS run as a

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          TARDIS now has a new widgets subpackage which makes it easier for
          Astrophysics researchers to interactively explore the data of a
          modeled Supernova, within their Jupyter notebooks. Currently, I have
          developed widgets for <a href="#shell-info-widget">Shell Info</a> and
          <a href="#line-info-widget">Line Info</a> but there are several other
          areas where interactive visualization and widgets can help. Besides
          the simplicity of exploration, another advantage of having widgets and
          visualization is that they showcase the capabilities of TARDIS and
          help new users to understand them better because now they can interact
          with it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Like <a href="https://jaladh-singhal.github.io/gsoc19/">last year</a>,
          this year also GSoC has helped me evolve by
          giving me knowledge about multiple fields as well as by allowing me to
          connect with a group of awesome people. I’m privileged to get a chance
          to work under such great mentors - <a
            href="https://github.com/wkerzendorf">Wolfgang Kerzendorf</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/ycamacho">Yssa Camacho</a>, <a

            href="https://github.com/harpolea">Alice Harpole</a>, and several
          other TARDIS members - who played a significant role in helping me
          complete this project. It is always fun to work with Open Source
          communities of your interest and thanks to Google Summer of Code that
          I got opportunity to work with TARDIS!
